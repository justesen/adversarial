# Applying Monte Carlo Tree Search to Quantified Boolean Formulas

In this project, I apply an algorithm based on Uniform Confidence bounds applied to Trees, a bandit based Monte Carlo
Tree Search algorithm, to the problem of evaluating Quantified Boolean Formulas, in order to determine the feasibility of
such an approach. The performance of the algorithm is compared with a standard DPLL based algorithm based on the
size of the search tree. Our results show that our algorithm is generally inferior to DPLL, and we discuss the reasons for
this and possible future work to remedy this.
